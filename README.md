## Thesis:
### Olympic Data 1924-2014

I produced some comparative data on Olympic male and female athletes. I compared the number of medals won by male and female athletes, including the number of gold medals, the change in the number of women participating, and the number of medals won by women in those sports. These data present a number of issues, such as the inevitable trend of increasing the status of female athletes as social consciousness continues to evolve, and the fact that gaining respect is not only about fighting discriminatory remarks, but also about challenging oneself and creating great results. Allowing female athletes to be celebrated for their achievements as women themselves should be part of the Olympic spirit of fairness and justice.
